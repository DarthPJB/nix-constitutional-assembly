# Zulip Q&A

After [joining Zulip](./zulip), you can ask the NCA questions in the [Assembly Q&A](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438035-Assembly-Q.26A) channel.
Answers by the whole assembly will also be available in the [qna](./qna) directory.

To keep the moderation surface for a textual assembly/board Q&A minimal, there is a simple structure:
- To ask a question, create a new topic with a single question
  - Indicate who the question is directed at (the assembly or specific members)
  - To signal interest in a question, react with :+1:, we will try to prioritise those
- Only assembly members can reply and discuss in the same topic, unless they explicitly ask the author for clarifications with a mention
  - If you violate this rule, we'll move your message and give a warning
  - Anybody is free to create follow-up questions by creating a new topic
