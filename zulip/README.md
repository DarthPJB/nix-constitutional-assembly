# Zulip

[Zulip](https://zulip.com/) (specifically [this instance](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/)) is the platform used for public governance discussions (and nothing else).
It is readable by anybody without logging in, but participation is very loosely limited.

## Participation

To participate on Zulip you have three options:

1. If you have previously **contributed to the Nix ecosystem**, [post a message](#how-to-post-a-message) containing a link to your contribution.

   The exact kind of contribution does not matter, it doesn't even have to be code or official, as long as it is _before 2024-05-01_ and _related to Nix_.

2. If you have made a substantial and constructive **contribution to setting up a successful community-based governance structure**, [post a message](#how-to-post-a-message) with a link to your contribution.

3. If you do not qualify for the above, but still believe you could contribute, reach out to the [Zulip moderators](#moderation) privately.

### How to post a message

For options 1 and 2:
- If you have a relevant contribution on GitHub, post a message in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/NixOS/foundation/issues/143)
- If your relevant contribution is outside of GitHub, post a message in [this Discourse thread](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/zulip-for-governance-discussions/44684)

The message should contain the following:

```markdown
Contribution: <link>
Email: <email>
```

As soon as a [Zulip moderator](#moderation) has confirmed your contribution, they'll send you an invite to the given Email address.

## Moderation

> [!Note]
> For now this is the [original policy](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/zulip-for-governance-discussions/44684) inherited from the foundation board, but the NCA is actively discussing how to handle Zulip moderation going forward and is likely to make changes soon.

Zulip is moderated to stay in line with the [Zulip CoC](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and to stay on-topic (governance discussions only). Compared to other community platforms recently, there is zero tolerance for CoC violations on Zulip, to make sure that civil discussion is possible. In addition to the CoC, make sure to read about [how to de-escalate situations](../deescalation.md).

To start off clean and give everybody a chance to participate in a civil way, we will consider allowing you to join **even if you've been suspended from other community platforms before**. You can send an email to one of the moderators with your appeal (along with a link to your contribution). If you've only been temporarily suspended you'll definitely be allowed to join. If you've been permanently banned, the Zulip moderators will deliberate based on your appeal. Note that you'll be watched closely, and **if you violate the CoC on Zulip, you will be banned permanently from all platforms** (for people that were suspended before).

The following people have been entrusted by the board to moderate. They also have the responsibility of inviting people as described above.
