# Assembly QnA Announcement

The assembly has not yet come to a decision on how to moderate Zulip going forward, but we intend to soon.

To keep the moderation surface for a textual assembly/board Q&A minimal, we're opening the [https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438035-Assembly-Q.26A/topic/stream.20events] with a simple structure:
- To ask a question, create a new topic with a single question
  - Indicate who the question is directed at (the assembly, the board or specific members)
  - To signal interest in a question, react with :+1:, we will try to prioritise those
- Only assembly/board members can reply and discuss in the same topic, unless they explicitly ask the author for clarifications with a mention
  - If you violate this rule, we'll move your message and give a warning
  - Anybody is free to create follow-up questions by creating a new topic

There will also be an open Q&A call on <time:2024-05-20T21:00:00+02:00> in https://meet.google.com/zkm-jcwr-ebi
