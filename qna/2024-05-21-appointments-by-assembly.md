[Question](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438035-Assembly-Q.26A/topic/Will.20the.20assembly.20appoint.20people.20to.20governance.20roles.3F/near/439700285): Its clear that the main task of the assembly is to come up with a governance system for the nix community. Will the assembly also be appointing the individualsh  that will initially occupy the roles in this system or is the expectation that part of defining the governance mechanism is defining how people are appointed to these roles, and that this process will be used for the initial appointments?

Part of the reason that I ask is that it would seem to me that this might not be possible if appointment relies on consensus from those already in governance in order to appoint people to new roles.

### Answer

Answer by the whole assembly:

We are not yet sure what governance bodies will be recommended for the new governance structure, and how their members will be determined, both initially and into the future.

It is possible that elections could be held for some bodies in the new governance structure.

For bodies which already exist and are functioning well, the assembly will work with existing membership to align current structures and document the path to future structures. This includes working with the most similar teams existing now, and with whoever is tasked with oversight of the newly constituted body (if anyone).

But many factors can affect the decisions for each specific case.
