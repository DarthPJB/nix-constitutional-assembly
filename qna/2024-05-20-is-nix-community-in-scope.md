[Question](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438035-Assembly-Q.26A/topic/.E2.9C.94.20Is.20nix-community.20in.20scope.20for.20technical.20governance.3F/near/439619047): For technical governance will nix-community be treated as a sort of incubation area before getting into the main NixOS repo? (For example home-manager can be re-implemented since that such a core part of the UX for nix for tons of people)

### Answer
Answer by the whole assembly: Definitely out of scope for the initial structure, but the resulting governance body could decide on a proposal to integrate nix-community in such a way, that the owners of nix-community could then accept.
