[Question](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/438035-Assembly-Q.26A/topic/taking.20in.20account.20systematic.20issue.20in.20related.20to.20governance/near/439487059): My question to the assembly is if they are taking into account systematic issues that exist in governance against marginalized folks. Marginalized people's participation is highly dependent on if the governance structure is fair and that there is careful implementation of the structure to make sure there aren't any systematic injustices against any marginalized groups.

### Answer

Answer by the whole assembly: We definitely want to take such systematic issues into account. The governance structure should be fair to everybody, regardless of marginalisation status. This is the aim even if no practical system can be perfectly fair to everybody.
