# Nix Constitutional Assembly

The Nix Constitutional Assembly (NCA) is a group of people tasked with establishing a community-based governance structure for Nix that is capable of serving the community's needs.

This repository is used for mutable persistent public documents about and by the NCA.

## Mission

The NCA's basic mission as [given by the board](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/board-update-2-assembly-appointment-process/45048#assembly-mission-and-goal-6) is to set up a governance structure, run by the community, that is capable of serving the community’s needs.
The following baselines have been given:
- The resulting governance structure needs to accommodate all official Nix resources including code, policies, websites, accounts, infrastructure, trademarks, finances, etc.
- While the NCA is free to choose any form or structure that they think is best for the project, they must ensure that the resulting governance structure’s decisions are representative of the entire community.
  This also requires defining what the community is.
- The resulting governance structure should be expected to provide stability to the community for the next 5 years.

As [indicated by the board](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/board-update-2-assembly-appointment-process/45048#assembly-lifetime-7), once the new governance structure is approved by the board, the NCA enters a transitory period to support the execution of the structure before finally disbanding.

## Communication

### Updates

To give updates or ask for community input, the NCA makes announcements on [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/announcements/constitutional-assembly/54), which you can get notifications for by clicking the bell icon.
The announcements are also mirrored to [Zulip](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/437619-assembly-announcements).

If you have questions for the NCA, you can either:
- Ask the [members](#members) privately
- Ask publicly in the [Q&A](./qna.md)

### Feedback and ideas

The NCA collects feedback and ideas from various spaces.

This includes public spaces such as:
- Community discussions on [Zulip](./zulip.md) in the [governance channel](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/435724-governance)
- Open calls: For updates and Q&A, occasionally announced as necessary

Furthermore, since public spaces don't work for everybody, you can also reach out to the [members](#members) privately, and the NCA may also reach out to some people as needed.
